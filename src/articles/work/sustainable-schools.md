Sustainable schools is a Zero Co product to encourage sustainable outreach for schools in Australia. The app allowed classes to sign up to a campaign, set money goals and share their fundraising pages with friends and family.

By purchasing Zero Co products, customers were donating to the schools campaign. I built the website, including the authentication, Shopify headless integration and admin management system.
