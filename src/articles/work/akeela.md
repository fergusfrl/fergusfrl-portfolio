Akeela is a mobile native application that supports safe outdoor adventuring. Interacting with GPS and bluetooth APIs, we can pinpoint user last known location and share that with emergency services if something goes wrong.

I build out the backend functionality for this app. I used Google Cloud Platform to build API's, databases, authentication, messaging and more.
