Collaborative Worklists is a patient management tool that enables the efficient management of patient cohorts on lists that can be seamlessly and securely shared with Clinical Portal users across the continuum of care.

We worked with Java, React and SQL to build excellent clinician workflows enabling them to better treat their patients. A highlight of working with Collaborative Worklists was when I ran the team to update the UI library and style guide for this product.
