Aura Cloud is a set of Web APIs and frontend products which connects radiography professionals to their patients. Aura can integrate with systems which support FHIR and HL7 messaging formats.

At Comrad, I helped build out robust APIs and contributed to front end clinician facing products enabling professionals to view and interact with patient data.
