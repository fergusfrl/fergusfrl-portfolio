I built NZ River Alerts to enable New Zealand river users to more accurately plan their trips and adventures around river levels. Additionally, farmers and land owners found this app useful to predict flooding and drought events.

This build included querying time series data from multiple IOT data sources, normalizing the data in a single repository and building a usable REST API on top of it. The frontend also includes complexity with authentication, mapping challenges and charting large data sets.

It's a great app which works well. I'm very proud of it.
